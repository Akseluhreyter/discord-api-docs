title: Changes to Bot Permissions for Interactions and Webhooks

#### Upcoming Changes

> warn
> Starting on **September 12, 2022**, apps that aren’t using the new `resume_gateway_url` field to resume gateway sessions will be disconnected significantly faster than normal.

Starting **August 3, 2022**, the way some of a bot's `MENTION_EVERYONE`, `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` and `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS` [permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions) are calculated is changing in two cases:
- When **responding to an [interaction](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING)** (like application commands or message components)
- When **executing a [webhook](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK) that the bot created**

Going forward, in the above cases, a bot’s `MENTION_EVERYONE`, `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` and `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS` permissions will be calculated based on the permissions its granted, *including* any [overwrites](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permission-overwrites). Previously, a bot’s permissions in these cases relied only on those granted to `@everyone`.

This change *only* applies to bots. The permissions for an app without a bot user (or without the `bot` scope) will still depend on `@everyone`.

#### Updating Your App

If your bot wants to use the `MENTION_EVERYONE`, `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` or `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS` permissions when responding to interactions or executing a webhook, **ensure that the bot was installed (or explicitly granted) with them**.

Note that even if your bot is installed with certain permissions, they can be changed using overwrites. For interactions, you can use the [`app_permissions` field](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-object-interaction-structure) to determine your app or bot's contextual permissions before replying.
