We've shipped some updates to the GameSDK, including support for Linux as well as the IL2CPP backend system for Unity. These changes also fixed a bug in the [`SetUserAchievement()`](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACHIEVEMENTS/setuserachievement) method.

Get the latest at the top of the [Getting Started](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/step-1-get-the-thing) documentation. If you're looking for help interacting with the GameSDK or want to report a bug, join us on the [official Discord](https://discord.gg/discord-developers).
